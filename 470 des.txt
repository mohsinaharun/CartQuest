* A clean homepage with:

   * Featured products

   * Categories (Men, Women, Electronics, etc.)

   * Filters on the left/top

   * Product grid in the center

Each product card shows:
      * Product image (main image)

      * Product name

      * Price (or price range if variants exist)

      * Small indicators (e.g., “Coins Earned”, “Discount Available”)

      * “Add to Cart” button

Behind the scenes
         * products table stores core product info

         * product_images table stores multiple images per product

         * variants table stores size/color combinations

         * categories table links products to categories

The frontend calls:
GET /api/products?category=Shoes&minPrice=100&maxPrice=300


The backend:
            * Joins product + images + variants

            * Applies category & price filters

            * Returns optimized JSON

B. Filtering Experience
User interaction
               * User selects:

                  * Category: “Sneakers”

                  * Price range: 200–500

The product grid updates instantly (no page reload).
Backend logic
                     * SQL / ORM filtering:

                        * Category ID match

                        * Variant price range match

                           * Only valid products returned

This makes browsing feel fast and modern.

C. Product Details & Variant Selection
Product Detail Page
When user clicks a product:
                              * Image gallery (from product_images)

                              * Product description

                              * Variant selectors:

                                 * Size buttons

                                 * Color swatches

                                    * Price updates dynamically based on variant

Important concept
Variants are treated as unique sellable items, not just UI options.
Behind the scenes:
                                       * Each variant has:

                                          * Variant ID

                                          * Price

                                          * Stock

                                          * Attributes (size, color)

D. Cart Management (Real-Time Feel)
Cart behavior
                                             * User clicks “Add to Cart”

                                             * Mini-cart slides in

                                             * Cart shows:

                                                * Product name

                                                * Selected variant

                                                * Quantity

                                                * Price

                                                * Remove button

Dynamic updates
If user:
                                                   * Changes quantity → total updates instantly

                                                   * Changes variant → price recalculates

                                                   * Removes item → cart updates

Backend APIs
                                                      * POST /cart/add

                                                      * PUT /cart/update

                                                      * DELETE /cart/remove

Cart logic:
                                                         * Cart items are tied to:

                                                            * User ID (or session ID)

                                                            * Product ID + Variant ID

                                                               * Totals calculated server-side for accuracy
